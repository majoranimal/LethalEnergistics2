#### Overview

Lethal Energistics 2 is an easy to use storage mod for Lethal Company, this mod revolves around the brand-new LE2 chamber furniture item, which can be purchased from the store for 200 credits.
The chamber gives the user the ability to store, sort, and sell their items in bulk, and helps reduce the lag that's caused by having such a large number of items on the ship.

#### Item List
The Item List menu allows you to easily manage your individual items, each item is displayed along with it's name, value, weight and handedness, and can be sorted by any of these values.
While in this menu you can select items and then use the bulk-sell or bulk-extract features, or extract and sell them individually.
In this menu there's also a feature, when given a target number of credits by the user, auto-selects the combination of items that will get you closest to your target, while still being above the target value.

#### Item Summaries
The Item Summaries menu is similar to the Item List but rather than showing individual items, it displays the combined statistics for each item type. 
For each item type this menu displays the item name, the number of items, the total value of the items, the total weight of the items, and the handedness of the items.
This menu also has equivalents to the Item Lists sell and extract features.

#### System Statistics
The System Statistics menu provides you with combined statistics for every game you've played with the mod installed.
Currently the menu displays your current stats (Items that are still in the system), your total stats (The statistics for every item that has been in the system during your current run), and lifetime stats (The combined statistics for every game you've ever played).

## Planned features:
- A menu that will allow you to deliver dropship items directly into the system rather than having to go out and collect them.
- Animations for items that show them being "sucked" into the system and "dropped" out.
- A vacuum tube or cannon that transfers items from the ship to shop when selling in Gordion
- Idle animations for players that are using the chambers terminal
- The ability to "store" players, this would compact the players bodies into cubes and lock their cameras into the new item (Although their cameras would be attatched they would still be counted as dead)

## Disclaimer
In the time that I've been procrastinating the completion of this mod other people have created similar mods that are (probably) better than this one.

## Credits
This mod was inspired by the minecraft mod Applied Energistics 2 (AE2).
