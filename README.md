#### Overview

Lethal Energistics 2 is an easy to use storage mod for Lethal Company, this mod is based on the LE2 chamber which can purchased from the store for 200 credits, this chamber has an area where items are inserted and extracted along with a monitor to manage the items, the monitor is split into multiple sections which are covered further down on this page.

#### Item List
The main terminal menu is a list of every stored item, each item is displayed with it's name, value, weight and handedness (Two-handed or not) and can be sorted by these values, while in this menu you can either select multiple items and bulk extract/sell or extract/sell them individually, this menu also contains the bulk select features which can automatically select the items that will sum to the lowest possible value above a target, this allows you to sell the optimal items to prevent going over quota.

#### Item Summaries
The second menu is per item summaries, this menu displays per item totals showing you the exact weight of your 57 rubber ducks, this menu displays the item name, number of items, value of the items, weight of the items, and handedness of the items, on top of these features you can sell or extract entire groups of items using this menu.

#### System Statistics
The third menu is the system statistics, this menu allows you to view statistics for every item in the system split into three sections, these sections are current (Items that are still in the system), total (Items that have been in the system in the current game), and lifetime (All items that have ever been in the system).

## Planned features:
- A menu that will allow you to deliver dropship items directly into the system rather than having to go out and collect them, to keep this fair the dropship still makes noise when it lands on top of the ship and could lure dogs inside.
- Animations for items being "sucked" into the system and "dropped" back out
- A vacuum tube with animations for selling items when on Gordion
- Idle animations for players using the chamber terminal
- The ability to "store" living players, this would compact the players wall-e style and lock their cameras into the new item (Despite the camera being attached they would be counted as dead)

## Thanks
This mod was inspired by the minecraft mods Applied Energistics 2 and Refined Storage along with the terraria mod Magic Storage.
